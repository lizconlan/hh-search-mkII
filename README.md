An attempt at making a search for Historic Hansard based on the salvaged search index and data culled from the original database.

Lots of code being recycled from the original Hansard project, will try to make credit where it's due clearer once I've finished cherrypicking the most useful bits.

Very much a work in progress - currently somewhere between a train wreck and a cargo cult, approach with caution and don't expect the tests to pass.
